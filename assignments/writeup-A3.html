(##) A3T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 
The time for this one is relatively short, about an hour. But I seemed to fail on 2 test cases listed on Piazza, not sure if they
are corret though. I double checked my formula but could't find out where the problem is.  

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that camera rays properly fill up the camera view frustrum.

(##) A3T2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 
The second task was also ok, didn't spend too much time doing it. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task2.*.cpp` files and 
checking that rendering spheres and triangles works properly.

(##) A3T3 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 
The third task I spend the most time. It was a solid two days and a half. It was very tough ;-; specifically didn't 
know what to do when the function kept recursing when I didn't take care well of the case that primitives are all on one side of the partition.
Right now it has 12 buckets and works alright.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task3.*.cpp` files and 
checking that the generated BVH looks reasonable and rendering large meshes is fast and correct.
