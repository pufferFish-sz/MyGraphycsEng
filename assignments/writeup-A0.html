Your completion of this task will be graded based on your `test.a0.task2.problems.cpp` file and your responses to the below questions.

For each of the problems you solved in task 2, characterise the bug in your own words and explain one other scenario that may cause this
type of bug.

Problem 1: 1) Didn't include std, the standard library in front of strings 2) cout was mispelled 3) missed a semicolon

Problem 2: The division of 2 integers rounds down, so the lambda function needed to cast the numerator to a float to ensure accurate comparison

Problem 3: The C++ vector::end() function is used to get the iterator that points to the vector one-past-last element, so we needed to
point the iterator one back.

Problem 4: The logical check if the 3 numbers are the same wasn't quite right, having (vec1.at(i) == vec2.at(j)) == vec3.at(k) means that the
the front half (vec1.at(i) == vec2.at(j)) is a boolean statment, and can only be either 0 or 1, which doeosn't really compare if the 3 numbers are
the same.
